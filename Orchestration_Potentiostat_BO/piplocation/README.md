Once you install the NIMSOS Python library (pip install nimsos), you shall see the installed files in the installation location, which differs in every device based on the operating system. "piplocation" is what we use to refer to that location. Once there, we used the files here, which includes all the Bayesian Optimisation (BO) files, in which the label starts with ai_tool_smac3 as it is followed by the labels used in the NIMSOS orchestration platform (https://nimsos-dev.github.io/nimsos/docs/en/introduction.html).
