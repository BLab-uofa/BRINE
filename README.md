## Orchestration Software

The orchestration operating system (OS) employed in this work was adapted from  
**[NIMS-OS](https://github.com/nimsos-dev/nimsos)**, developed by Tamura *et al.* (2023),  
which enables a closed-loop integration between **artificial intelligence** and **robotic experimentation** in materials science.
